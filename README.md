# Opencrowd : Crowdfunding Platform Powered by Ethereum Blockchain

Opencrowd is a crowdfunding platform that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for enhanced security, transparency, and global contribution. The platform is currently live on the Goerli Test Network and can be accessed at - [opencrowd.vercel.app](https://opencrowd.vercel.app/).

## Problem Statement and Necessity

Crowdfunding has become an increasingly popular way to raise funds for various projects, causes, and individuals in need. However, the current crowdfunding platforms have their limitations, which we aimed to address through Opencrowd.

The major problems we wanted to solve include:

### Security

As the funds raised on crowdfunding platforms become larger, they need to be heavily secured. While stringent measures such as symmetric encryption are in place to make e-payment safe and secure, they are still vulnerable to hacking. By utilizing the blockchain, which has never been compromised yet, we can provide a higher level of security.

### Transparency and Anti-Fraud

Crowdfunding scams are not uncommon, and it is often difficult to track where the funds are being used. Opencrowd aims to make the entire flow of funds transparent at every stage, ensuring that there is no possibility of the money being misused.

### Global Contribution

Some crowdfunding platforms are country-specific, which makes it challenging for people from other countries to contribute to various campaigns. Using blockchain, anyone in the world can contribute to the campaign, and transactions are quick and convenient.

We were inspired by the CryptoRelief initiative, which raised approximately $1 billion for COVID relief in India from the entire global community in a highly transparent manner.

## Tech Stack

Opencrowd is built using the following tech stack:

-   Next JS
